# KNN-Implementation
from scratch, KNN implementation and plot


Pandas was used, dataset used is Breast Cancer dataset from Kaggle
first data cleaning was done
KNN function was created, keeping in mind input parameters
to bring modularity, another function was created so as to run the previous function made
during data clining, histogram was chosen to filter the data to 2 columns only for plotting KNN

in data there are 32 features, 1st useless, 2nd being target, and rest 30 are 3x10 columns, with 10 features' mean,std and worst reults divided in 3 groups
we take mean data only for KNN plotting which is further cleaned.
